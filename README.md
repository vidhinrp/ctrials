This dashboard provides insights into clinical trials data using ClinicalTrials.gov data. 
ClinicalTrials.gov is a comprehensive database that provides detailed information 
about clinical studies conducted worldwide. It includes key data such as study titles, 
NCT IDs, statuses, phases, and medical conditions being investigated.
This resource enhances transparency in clinical research and supports informed decision-making for 
patients and healthcare professionals.

You must load the data into the directory for the dashboard to work. In order to do this, download the data
and create a duckdb database using the instructions on top of the ct-util.R file.
